This repository contains my work in Microsoft Excel.

**Objective**

- To analyze the Host Behaviour of a property rental company towards fulfilling the customer requirements.
- The prime objective was to analyze the different metrics such as acceptance rate, response rate, instant booking, review scores, etc to draw a distinction between a Normal Host and a SuperHost.

**Dataset Description**

The analysis was done on the dataset of two cities in Canada i.e, Toronto and Vancouver and each city having four tables namely Hosts, Listings, Reviews and Avilaibility.
